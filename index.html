          <p>
                <b>VoiceStar</b> is an autoregressive voice cloning (zero-shot) text-to-speech model, that can precicely control the output duration and generation speech longer than maximal training duration during inference
          </p>
          <p>
              To clone an unseen voice or edit a recording, VoiceStar needs only a few seconds of the voice.
              Trained on 30 seconds speech, VoiceStar can generate 40 seconds long speech.

"You are quite a little soldier," complimented Betty, as she got out the bandages and salve. "You are very brave." "Oh, I haven't got any kick coming," he answered, with a laugh. "Of course, this cut foot will make me travel slow for a while, and I can't get to all my customers on time. But I guess they'll save their trade for me--the regulars will. "I might be worse off," the lad continued, after a pause. "I might be in as bad a hole as that fellow I saw on the train not long ago." "How was that?" asked Betty, more for the sake of saying something rather than because she was interested.</td>

Now, if it be true, as I have asserted, that genuine art is an unmixed blessing to the world,</td>

DARLING ETHEL: I loved your little letter. Here there are lots of funny little lizards that run about in the dusty roads very fast, and then stand still with their heads up. Beautiful red cardinal birds and tanagers flit about in the woods, and the flowers are lovely. But you never saw such dust.</td>
